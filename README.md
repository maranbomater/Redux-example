# redux_example

This is a simple [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) example in ReactJS. Here you can find members of [Ars Futura](http://arsfutura.co/) team in Redux store. Here you can find some code and see how to write `actions`, `action creators`, `reducers`. Also, you can easily see the difference between `components` and `containers`, or how developers like to say: `smart and dumb components`.
